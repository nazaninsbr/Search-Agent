main function 
	
	1 - create an instance of the maze class 
	2 - then it calls the setup_maze function of the maze class
	3 - it then creates an instance of the Displayer classes and passes the maze as an argument

	4 - there are a bunch of commented lines that will check our algorithm 

	5 - we are asked if we want to exit or to save the file 

lets see what each step does:
	1 - calls the __init__ function that creates some variables 
		* cell
		* nrows
		* ncols 
		* goal 
		* start

	2- setup_maze is the function that asks us if we want to load the maze or generate a random one 
		* this function calls the generate_maze function if we ask it to generate a maze
		* calls read_from_file if we ask it to load the maze

			-- read_from_file


			-- generate_maze
